    <h1>The Year That Changed Everything</h1>

   <p>
      Happy New Year, my venus!! This year had its ups and downs—I met people, I let go of some.
      Decisions aren't always up to us, usually, it's up to fate and destiny. The best decision
      I've ever made that was set up by destiny itself was meeting you and getting closer with you.
      Security and comfort are what I longed for, and you gave me those. No words are deep enough to
      express how much I love you, yet words are all I could do to describe it.

    <p>
      My love for you extends beyond time and reason. Most would say that we're fast-paced in terms
      of how early we gave our "yes" and "I love you"'s. But if time can go by fast, why can't love do
      the same? You showed me what it feels like to be loved, seen, and appreciated. Even when I
      felt lonely and unheard, you were always here to listen. You're the best thing that has ever
      happened to me and one of the greatest blessings God has given me.

    <p>
      2025 was a whirlwind of emotions, like, literally. But amidst all the chaos, we found each
      other. I pray to God everyday for your safety and protection, that you may achieve all your
      goals and climb to greater heights, and that happiness and success are what lies ahead of you.
      God gives us what we need, not what we want. And God gave me you when I needed someone the most.
    <p>
      I love you sosososooo much. I will live my days continuously telling you that. Thank you for
      loving me loudly and quietly at the same time. Just know that I'll always be here for you—in
      your good times, your bad times, whenever you're mad, sick, or simply need someone to talk to.
    </p>
      Thank you for being with me through 3/4 of my 2025. You were the highlight of my year.
      I love you, my darling venus, for as long as the earth revolves around the sun.
      My heart is always with you.
